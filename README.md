# Medical-Inventory-Management
Medical Inventory management is a trial project in the form of the website to store the data of the medicines such as brand count name etc. This id one to enhance my skills and learning of the web development languages which are, HTML, CSS, Javascript, Bootstrap, Nodejs and Postgresql. I tried postgres because i was tired of MySQL and wanted to try something new but they both are almost same.
